Algorithm to find whether a number is prime or composite:

1.Start
2.Accept a positive integer 'n(number greater than 2)
3.Initialize counter variable with value 2
4.Divide 'n' with the counter variable
5.If the remainder is zero, display that 'n' is composite and stop
6.If the remainder is not zero, else increment the counter and repeat from step 4 until the counter value is less than 'n'
7.After completion of all the steps display that the number 'n' is prime
8.Stop
